# 06.Tracker App

> Your task now is to run a simple JavaScript front-end app based on Vue.js for keeping track of daily duties in a Docker container. It does not need anything but an image to run. It does not use a database or any other types of storage. 
You're provided with its files it in the resources, together with a Dockerfile which runs the app on NGINX server: 

>First, build a custom image {username}/tracker_app from the given Dockerfile:

>Push the image to Docker Hub:

>Then, use it to run the Vue app in a container (think about the internal port on which the app works):

>Finally, access the app from the browser â€“ it should be working:
