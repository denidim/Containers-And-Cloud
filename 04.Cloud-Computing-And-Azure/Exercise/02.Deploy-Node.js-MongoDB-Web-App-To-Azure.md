# Deploy a Node.js + MongoDB Web App to Azure

>You are provided with a Node.js app with a MongoDB database called "TODO App" in the resources. You should upload the app to GitHub, as a start, and then deploy it to Azure, using Azure App Service and Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB.

>Step 1. Upload TODO app in Github repo

>Step 2. Azure Portal -> Create Web App + DB -> Create new Resource Group -> Give App Name -> Chose runtime stack [Node 18 LTS] -> Chose DB [Cosmos DB API for MongoDB] -> Copy the generated Database Name 

>Step 3. Configuration -> App Service app -> Create [New application setting] with:
Name: "DATABASE_NAME" 
Value: the automatically generated database name you copied earlier

>Step 4. Select the "MONGODB_URI" connection string on the same page and copy its value

>Step 5. Create one more new application setting with: 
Name: "DATABASE_URL" 
Value: the "MONGODB_URI" connection string you copied earlier (i.e., mongodb://...)

>Step 6. Save SetTings

>Your app is configured to work with the Azure database, so you should just go to the "Deployment Center" page and deploy the app from the GitHub repository. 

>A GitHub workflow should be created and it should show a status of "Complete". It takes about 15-30 minutes. 

>You should be able to access the app on https://app-name.azurewebsites.net and work with it.
